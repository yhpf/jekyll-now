title: Between hope and despair - week 4

When you thought you were ok with week 1-3, week 4 hits you like a wall. Once you realize that you didn’t really get week 3, week 4 and project 2 all of a sudden feels like climbing Mount Everest. 


I’m doing ok on the weekly quizzes and it felt like I barely made it through the presentation of project 2. This week we covered Classification, Logistic Regression, GLM, Model Evaluation I & II and Hyperparameter tuning. It has been very theoretically heavy and still (in my opinion) a little bit too much nice to know stuff. I hope that they get better at time management (I mean you can’t solve the fact that the lesson is to long by talking faster or rushing through things), The end result is that we are lacking big time in the practical parts. It’s just a long steep hill when you have to google on what code to use in lab after lab. 


I know that we are going to have some days in the program that we feel are better and some that we feel are worse. This week had a little bit to many of the last category. But also some highlights when you managed to solve something. I guess every week with a project (every second week) will be kind of worse.


Now we are also slowly starting with the Capstone project on top of everything else. I hope that will be more fun. The choices are yours and you might actually be interested in what insights the end result will bring. 


A nice thing that actually took place this week was the Hacknight that <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/">Women Who Code NYC</a> had at eBay. Katrina Evtimova from eBay’s Data Science team held a presentation about 2 python projects that she had done and she also talked about Pytorch and Awesome Python. Then we were free to work on a project of our own choice. 


Bring on week 5!
