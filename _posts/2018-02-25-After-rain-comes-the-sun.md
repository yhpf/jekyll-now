Wow time flies!

I think that a lot of people felt a little bit down after week 4, but it all got better after a weekend and some encouraging words in the Monday morning. They said that the week 4 probably was the worst in the entire program. Well, let us hope so!

Week 5 was most of the time really interesting, we covered NLP, SpaCy, Naive Bayes, Webscraping and APIs. Personally I think that NLP is super interesting and that you can do a lot of things with it. I’m pretty sure I want to use that in my capstone project in some way. Webscraping is very useful and seem not that hard, I’m glad I know some HTML from before. The tricky part seem to be when you are going to use an API and the API is not very well documented. 

Other nice things that during week 5 was, a company visit at Priceline and I had booked time with our TA. She is super smart and really nice. It’s so great that we finally got a TA. The week ended with midterm exams and the we were supposed to have our first 4 min presentation on capstone project ideas, but that did not happen. It was pushed to week 6. 

Then came the Presidents Day weekend and we had the Monday of in week 6. Nice that you could try to catch up and work on the project (project 3 btw). I week 6 we covered CART, Bagging, Random forest, Boosting, SVM and Gradient Descent. All the stuff that has to do with trees seem useful as well and pretty easy to use thanks to sklearn.

The project presentation that was supposed to take place on the Friday was pushed to Monday. But we did have the capstone project presentation about 3 different ideas to go with.
