2 weeks have passed again. We have covered deep learning (neural networks, tensorflow, Keras, Regularization in NNs and convolutional neural networks) and unsupervised learning (topic modeling, network analysis, vlustering, hierachical clustering, DBSCAN and PCA).

We have also completed project 4, a group project, and we had our 2nd deadline for the capstone project. My project is about the mood of music around the globe. I'm sure I will tell you more about it later. It's nice in one way that there are less labs now, but it is so that we will have time to work on the projects. So overall it still feels like it's at least as much to do as before. Now project 5 is also coming up and it feels like they have scrambled that together just to have a fifth project. I usually love project work, but to be honest I have a hard time feeling passionate about something that feels like we are doing it just for the sake of it. It's is not going to be used for anything and it's not helping anyone and so on. (Note: This does not include the capstone project however.)

It has also been a lot of work with outcomes the past weeks. Mostly because we will have a hackaton comming up on the 23rd of March at Deloitte. That will come as a nice break from school. To use your skills in another way and to get at better picture of what it is in a more worklike environment. 

It is slowly sinking in that this program is soon comming to its end. What to do after the program. Well I need to keep on working on my python skills as well as transfering stuff from my GA GitHub to my privat GitHub account. My plan is to turn the "GitHub blog" into a personal webpage and then us my Medium blog as my blog (no more cross posting).

And work we have to start to apply for work. That is a fun part. My dream role is to work as a Data analyst at a small to medium sized tech company. So if anyone that is hiering is reading this...here I am! :)
